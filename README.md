Hello!
In this repository is a code I use for a project in class at school where we are tasked to make a game using the "Aruino Uno r3" kit. 
The code is for a "Simon Says" game where the lights from the "Aruino Uno r3" kits will light up and you are to press the button on the kit that matches the light. 
As you press the light, it will flash faster and in a multiple pattern, getting more difficult each level.
